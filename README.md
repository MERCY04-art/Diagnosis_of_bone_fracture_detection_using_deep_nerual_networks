# Diagnosis of Bone Fracture Detection Using Deep Neural Networks

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for diagnosing bone fractures using deep neural networks, specifically Google MobileNet and ManualNet. These models are designed to accurately and efficiently detect bone fractures from medical imaging data.

## Features
- **Lightweight Architecture:** Utilizes MobileNet for deployment on mobile and embedded devices.
- **Custom Model:** Incorporates ManualNet, a custom-designed neural network, tailored for specific dataset characteristics.
- **High Accuracy:** Combines the strengths of both networks to enhance detection accuracy.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed for easy integration into medical imaging workflows.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FractureFinder.git
cd FractureFinder
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
### Training the Model
To train the model, ensure you have your dataset prepared and formatted correctly. Then run the training script:

```bash
python train.py --dataset_path /path/to/your/dataset --model MobileNet
```

### Evaluating the Model
To evaluate the trained model on a validation set, use the evaluation script:

```bash
python evaluate.py --model_path /path/to/your/model --dataset_path /path/to/your/validation_set
```

### Detecting Fractures
To use the trained model for fracture detection on new images, run the detection script:

```bash
python detect.py --model_path /path/to/your/model --image_path /path/to/your/image
```

## Model Architecture
### MobileNet
MobileNet is a lightweight convolutional neural network designed for efficient image classification on mobile and embedded devices. It uses depthwise separable convolutions to reduce the number of parameters and computational cost.

### ManualNet
ManualNet is a custom-designed neural network tailored to the specific characteristics of the bone fracture dataset. It is designed to complement MobileNet, enhancing detection accuracy by focusing on the unique features of the data.
